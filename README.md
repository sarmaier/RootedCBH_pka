We developed a QM/ML framework with random forest to accurately predict the pKa of complex molecules using physics-based features from DFT and structural features from our CBH fragmentation protocol. Our model can correct the functional group specific deficiencies associated with DFT and achieve impressive accuracy on two benchmark test sets, the SAMPL6 and Novartis datasets.

Example of RootedCBH where nitrogen is the site of protonation. Fragments in gray are either not present in the molecule or do not correspond to the fragment with the minimum path length.
